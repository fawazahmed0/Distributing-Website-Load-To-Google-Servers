# Distribution-website-load-to-google-servers

This prototype implementation can be used to solve problem of exam results site getting crashed on result publishing day due to large number of users accessing at same time.

I have used Google blogger to host result publishing website and Google drive to host my resut database file as Google servers will not crash even if large number of people access the site at same time and also you don't have to setup servers yourself thus saving costs.

Please refer to my documentation for full information:
